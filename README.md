### Dataset description
It consists of nearly 100 images of men and women wearing clothes that belong to 5 different styles (Sportswear, Fancy, Streetwear, Preppy, Techwear).

### Objective
AI Fashion Discriminator's objective is to guide the user to dress up in the style they so desire, by telling them the style their current outfit belongs to.

### Models
There are three models within this project, 1 of them follows a tree-like structure, the other two are multiclass discriminators, powered by CNN, however, one of them does not use the processed dataset.
